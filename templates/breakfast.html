<p class="mainpara">Breakfast is an important meal of the day.
As the name spells, it is the meal we eat to break the fast of the entire night.<br>
There is a saying “Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, and dinner like a beggar”-
    this saying means to have a lavish breakfast like a king, which shows the importance of the breakfast.
    Here, lavish doesn’t only mean many varieties of food, but a lavishly balanced diet.<br><br>
As we start the day, we need a great boost, be it spiritually, mentally, and physically.And breakfast plays a
    vital role in providing that boost to kick-start the day.<br><br>
Due to many changes in our lifestyles, we often tend to have breakfast late or skip it entirely,
    which is not at all recommended.The reasons like “woke up late”, “didn’t have time for breakfast”,
    and “not hungry”, are inexcusable.<br><br>
Here we provide a few breakfast recipes which help in maintaining that balance start to our day.
